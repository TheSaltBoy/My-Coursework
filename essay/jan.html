			<h2 id="bio">Biography</h2>
					<div><p><span class="dropcap">T</span>schichold was perhaps one of the greatest influences on modern typography in the 20th century. Of himself he wrote: “Two men stand out as the most powerful influences on 20th-century typography: Stanley Morison, who died in 1967, and Jan Tschichold.” Tschichold was well aware of the impact he had on the world of graphic design. His bravado is more than justified however, as his work influenced design during and long after his life.</p>

					<p>In 1902 Jan Tschichold was born to German parents Maria and Franz. His father was a sign painter, and consequently he was trained in calligraphy from a young age.</p>

					<p>Originally Tschichold wanted to become a fine artist, though his parents did not agree. A compromise was found, and it was decided that Jan would become a teacher of illustration.</p>

					<p>Jan received little formal education. His passion and personal studies drove his learning. At the young age of 14 he began teaching in Grimma, near his home town of Leipzig. Not three years later, Tschichold stopped teaching and began studying typography under a man named Hermann Delitsch in the Academy for Graphic Arts in Leipzig.</p>

					<p>The professors Tschichold worked with did not see him as a student bus as a contemporary. Delitsch “often said that there was not anything he could teach that Tschichold did not already know” and gave him free rein to do as he pleased.</p>

					<p>During his time in Leipzig Tschichold concerned himself with script designers both old and contemporary. He often visited Rudolf Koch and used his handwriting as a template for some of his own designs.</p>

					<p>During this time the discipline of typography was in its infancy. Bold, German blackletter typefaces were disproportionately used, while sans-serif (grotesk) and regular weight typefaces were uncommon. Little thought was given to standardization of typography, and typefaces were combined in a single design without a care. These haphazard practices were probably what drove Tschichold’s obsession with book layout and typographic design.</p></div>

				<h2 id="bauhaus">Bauhaus Influence</h2>
					<div><p>Tschichold’s visit to Weimar in 1924, and his exposure to the Bauhaus movement, marked the beginning of his war on typography. There he met artists such as Moholy-Nagy, Lissitzky, Schwitters, and many others.</p> 

					<p>Bauhaus was a progressive movement, and one with ties to many other movements such as De Stijl and Russian Constructivism. Moholy-Nagy said that “typography is communication through print.”</p>

					<p>Tschichold claimed that he left the exhibition “in a state of great agitation.” It is clear that Bauhaus had a profound impact on Tschichold. He began to refer to himself as Ivan in the spirit of the Russian revolution. His previously classicist style of typography gave way to a much more modern style. It was like night and day, and this change happened almost overnight.</p></div>

				<h2 id="die">Die Neue Typographie</h2>
					<div><p>Due to his influences from Bauhaus Tschichold became ever more frustrated with the typography practices of the time. He began to form his own rules. “Clarity of message”, like Moholy-Nagy, was Tschichold’s goal. He rejected traditional layouts, calling them “box-style”, and claimed they were boring and lacked hierarchy of importance.</p>

					<p>In 1927 he joined The Circle of New Advertising, and group formed by Bauhaus artist Kurt Schwitters. It was with this group that Tschichold formulated the principles that would make Die Neue Typographie.</p>

					<p>At the time the book was extremely controversial, with as many clinging to its precepts as those outright rejecting them. Regardless of its reception it had a profound impact on typographical design then and now.</p>

					<p>Die Neue Typographie was Tschichold’s manifesto. He felt extremely passionate in how type should be designed. He believed that it should be functional, short, simple, compelling, and objective. Tschichold abandoned his use of classical and blackletter typefaces, believing that they hindered international communication. Under his new movement, Tschichold began to exclusively use sans-serif typefaces and preferred non-centred designs. He also began utilizing photography and geometric shapes in his designs, similar to the Modernism and Bauhaus movements. “The precise picture, i.e. photography, must be considered a basic constant of the New Typography.”</p>

					<p>The influence of this work can be seen even into the modern day. The use of off-centre layouts and geometric shapes, as well as the utilization of different font weights to form a hierarchy of information may seem elementary to graphic designers today, but at the time was a radical diversion from the norm.</p>

					<p>Tschichold fought tooth and nail to spread his movement and vision. His radical philosophy and self-importance may initially seem off-putting, but his infectious influence cannot be denied. Almost single-handedly Tschichold redefined typographic design. Though not all adopted his style at the time, most came to follow at least some of his tenets of design.</p></div>

				<h2 id="nazi">The Rise of the Nazis and Flight from Germany</h2>
				
				<!--Redactions allude to the book burnings perfomed by the Nazis of "unsavoury" materials-->
				
					<div><p>Tschichold’s design standards were in direct opposition to those of the Nazis <span class="redacted">[][][][][][]</span> . His work was seen as <span class="redacted">[][][][]</span>  “un-German” <span class="redacted">[][][][][][][][][][][]</span> , using simple sans-serif typefaces and off-centred design, which was in contrast to the bold blackletter typefaces of the Nazis. </p>

					<p>In 1933 Tschichold and his wife were arrested and much of their property seized by the Gestapo. Communist material was found in his home, further casting suspicion on him. All copies of Tschichold’s books were seized and presumably many were burned.</p>

					<p>Artists like <span class="redacted">[][][][][]</span> Paul Renner and Tschichold were denounced as “cultural Bolshevists”, essentially supporters of the communist political movement. Thankfully however, Tschichold was able to escape Germany with his wife <span class="redacted">[][][][][][][][][][]</span>  and moved to Switzerland in August 1933. Apart from his work in England, Tschichold spent the rest of his life in Switzerland, dying there in 1974.</p>

					<p>Most likely due to his treatment by and the abhorrent acts of the Nazis, Tschichold’s design philosophy began to change. In his words he said: “In time, typographical things, in my eyes took on a very different aspect. I detected the most shocking parallels between the teachings of <span class="redacted">[][][][][][][][][][]</span> Die Neue Typographie and National Socialism<span class="redacted">[][][][][][][][][][]</span>. Obvious similarities exist in the ruthless restriction of typefaces, and the more or less militaristic arrangement of lines.”</p>

					<p>Tschichold’s work shifted from  <span class="redacted">[][][][][][][][][][]</span> non-standard <span class="redacted">[][][][]</span>modern designs to more classical ones. He substituted sans-serif typefaces for more traditional serifs.</p></div>

				<h2 id="penguin">Penguin Books</h2>
					<div><p>Penguin books brought literature and higher culture to the masses cheaply. Tschichold caught founder Allen Lane’s attention, and he was brought to England to standardise and redesign the popular series of books.</p>

					<p>Tschichold’s introduction to the organisation was not entirely welcome, and many printers struggled against his decisions. Tschichold developed the “Penguin Composition Rules”, a booklet outlining the layout and design of the book series. With these rules Tschichold was able to unify and standardise the design of the Penguin range of books.</p>

					<p>Tschichold concerned himself with every aspect of the book design, from the layout of the cover with its unalterable grid design, to the very feel of the pages. </p>

					<p>Though his design philosophies may have changed since moving away from Germany, the principles in Die Neue Typographie can still be seen in the Penguin books. The use of sans-serif fonts can be seen on the covers, where Tschichold used Gill Sans. Although he used a centred layout for the covers, he utilised varying weights within the type to give a hierarchal structure.</p>

					<p>Maybe the most important principle of Die Neue Typography was that information must be communicated clearly and simply. His redesigns of Penguin Books brought a simplicity and consistency that made the books more accessible to the average person. Tschichold said: “We do not need pretentious books for the wealthy, we need more really well-made ordinary books.”</p>

					<p>The Penguin Books redesign is perhaps one of Tschichold’s crowning achievements, and definitely one of his more long-lasting accomplishments. His design standards are still largely followed today with few variations.</p></div>

				<h2 id="sabon">Sabon</h2>
					<div><p>Sabon was Tschichold’s final great achievement. It is a typeface whose design is based on types by Claude Garamond. Sabon is a classical typeface primarily used for body texts. It was designed to look the same whether it was set by hand or by a Monotype or Lithotype machine. It’s almost strange for Tschichold to develop a serif font after his emphasis on sans-serif type in his early life.</p>

					<p>Now owned by Linotype, Sabon was later redesigned into Sabon Next by Jean-Francois Porchez.</p></div>

				<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
					<div><p>Jan Tschichold was a bold and passionate man. He was not afraid to walk down untraveled avenues of design, and embraced the controversy that surrounded his work. His influences can be felt and seen even today. Die Neue Typographie revolutionised the use of typography and set a standard for modern design. His work with Penguin Books has faced the test of time, and standards he implemented are still followed to this day. Much of what we consider fundamental to modern design began with Tschichold. Of him Paul Rand said: “For his vision, his sensitivity and dedication, for being a pioneer typographer, a master of his craft and typographical historian, for teaching us awareness of the new and respect for the old… for pointing out those subtleties and refinements without which we would be the poorer, for his integrity, his restraint, and for his quality, I salute Jan Tschichold.” </p></div>
